#### Introduction
Well this was written ages ago... but since Dropbox just removed public folder support, I can't do my hacky Dropbox web hosting via Tumblr thing haha. So I moved everything over here. There are some neat things where a python script dynamically generates a html page based on the folder structure the pictures are in. That also means my pictures will be in github ... oh well (don't steal them!)
